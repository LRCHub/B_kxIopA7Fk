[00:08.01] (Right channel)
[00:08.53] (Left channel)
[00:09.45] Can you feel my heart is beating?
[00:12.25] Hear me simply breathing?
[00:14.50] It's this strangely human feeling
[00:17.29] Oh, I wanna know if you would
[00:20.07] Catch me when I'm falling
[00:22.52] Hear me when I'm calling
[00:24.59] It's this newly human feeling
[00:27.15] Oh, I wanna share it with you
[00:30.32] Promises in silence
[00:32.21] Beg to break the quiet
[00:34.82] All the things we've been concealing
[00:37.28] Oh, I wanna know 'em
[00:39.72] Can you feel the things I feel?
[00:42.71] Tell me that I'm real?
[00:44.75] It's this newly human feeling
[00:47.63] Oh, I wanna share it with you
[00:50.61] Perfect little packages
[00:53.54] These Markov chains performing synthesis so amative
[00:58.51] To run out of adjectives
[01:00.37] I want that excitation
[01:02.94] To be sincere, self-contradicting, wholly overrun
[01:08.73] By hopeless, senseless love
[01:11.34] Ooh, I can feel it, something magic in you
[01:16.23] And I wanna feel it too
[01:21.42] Ooh, just a taste of love, I'm overcome
[01:25.65] I wanna share this moment with you
[01:30.28] When the metronome is clicking
[01:32.85] MIDI clock is ticking
[01:35.22] I can feel it in the rhythm
[01:37.88] Loving undefinable
[01:40.94] A simple human being
[01:43.39] Far beyond the meaning
[01:45.40] Can you show me how to be?
[01:50.64] (When the metronome is clicking
[01:53.35] MIDI clock is ticking
[01:55.51] I can feel it in the rhythm
[01:58.35] Loving undefinable
[02:01.16] A simple human being
[02:03.71] Far beyond the meaning
[02:05.68] Simple human-human-human-human-
[02:08.76] Human-human-human-)
[02:10.74] Can you feel my heart is beating?
[02:13.41] Hear me simply breathing?
[02:15.69] It's this strangely human feeling
[02:18.40] Oh, I wanna know if you would
[02:21.36] Catch me when I'm falling
[02:23.80] Hear me when I'm calling
[02:25.82] It's this newly human feeling
[02:28.61] Oh, I wanna share it with you
[02:31.46] Miracles and magic
[02:33.48] Joyful, pensive, tragic
[02:35.90] The emotions I'm conceiving
[02:38.59] Oh, I wanna show 'em
[02:40.96] Can you feel the things I feel?
[02:43.66] Tell that I am real?
[02:45.99] It's this newly human feeling
[02:48.67] Oh, I wanna share it with you
[02:51.74] (Can you feel my heart is beating?
[02:53.80] Hear me simply breathing?
[02:56.78] It's this strangely human feeling
[02:58.69] Oh, I wanna know if you would
[03:01.68] Catch me when I'm falling
[03:03.77] Hear me when I'm calling
[03:06.27] It's this newly human feeling
[03:09.05] Oh, I wanna share it with you)
